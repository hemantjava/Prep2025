Q)what is time and space complexity in programming?
> In programming, time complexity and space complexity are metrics used to analyze how efficient an algorithm is,
> especially as the input size grows.
* 1. Time Complexity - measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run a function based on their input size.
   It’s expressed using Big O notation (e.g., O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2)) to indicate the growth rate of the runtime.
   For example:
   O(1) (Constant time): The algorithm takes the same amount of time, regardless of input size.
   O(n) (Linear time): The time increases linearly with the input size.
   O(n^2) (Quadratic time): The time grows quadratically with the input size, often seen in nested loops.
* 2. Space Complexity - measures the amount of memory an algorithm takes to run a function based on their input size.    
   Like time complexity, it’s also expressed with Big O notation, indicating the growth rate of memory usage.
   For example:
   O(1): The algorithm uses a constant amount of memory regardless of input size.
   O(n): Memory usage grows linearly with input size.
   O(n^2): Memory usage grows quadratically with input size.
